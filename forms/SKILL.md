  Load this skill whenever the project contains forms, inputs, selects,
  checkboxes, radio buttons, text areas, or any validation flow. Under no
  circumstances create a form without visible labels, error identification, and
  keyboard accessibility. Absolutely always associate every input with a label
  and provide clear, accessible error messages.

# Forms Accessibility Skill

> **Canonical source**: `examples/FORMS_ACCESSIBILITY_BEST_PRACTICES.md` in `mgifford/ACCESSIBILITY.md`
> This skill is derived from that file. When in doubt, the example is authoritative.

Apply these rules when implementing or reviewing any form, input, or validation flow.
**Only load this skill if the project contains forms.**

---

## Core Mandate

All users must be able to understand, complete, and submit forms with assistive
technologies, keyboard-only input, and varying cognitive needs.

---

## Severity Scale (this skill)

| Level | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical** | Blocks task completion entirely for one or more disability groups |
| **Serious** | Significantly impairs access; workaround unreasonable to expect |
| **Moderate** | Creates friction; workaround exists and is not too burdensome |
| **Minor** | Best-practice gap; marginal impact on access |

---

## Critical: Labels

Every form control must have a programmatically associated label.
**Missing labels are Critical** — screen reader users cannot identify the field.

* Never use placeholder text as the sole label — it disappears on input, fails
  contrast requirements, and is not reliably announced by all screen readers
* Required fields must be identified in text, not by colour alone

```html
<!-- Bad: placeholder as only label — CRITICAL issue -->
<input type="email" placeholder="Email address">

<!-- Good: explicit label -->
<label for="email">
  Email address <span class="visually-hidden">(required)</span>
</label>
<input type="email" id="email" autocomplete="email" required>
```

**On `aria-required`:** Do not add `aria-required="true"` to native inputs
that already have the HTML `required` attribute — it is redundant and adds
noise to the accessibility tree. Use `aria-required` only on custom widgets
(e.g., `role="combobox"`, `role="listbox"`) that cannot use the native attribute.

---

## Critical: Error Identification

Errors must be programmatically associated with their field.
**Absent error identification is Critical** — blind users receive no indication
something is wrong.

* Mark invalid fields with `aria-invalid="true"`
* Error messages must be specific and actionable — not just "invalid input"
* Never use colour alone to indicate an error
* Associate the error message with the field via `aria-describedby`

```html
<label for="email">Email address</label>
<input type="email" id="email"
       aria-describedby="email-error"
       aria-invalid="true">
<span id="email-error" role="alert">
  Enter a valid email address, for example: name@example.com
</span>
```

Remove `aria-invalid` and the error message once the field is corrected.

---

## Critical: Error Summary

For multi-error submissions, provide a focused error summary so keyboard and
screen reader users are immediately oriented to what went wrong.
**No error summary on multi-error forms is Critical.**

```html
<div role="alert" aria-labelledby="error-heading"
     tabindex="-1" id="error-summary">
  <h2 id="error-heading">There are 2 errors in this form</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#email">Email address – enter a valid email</a></li>
    <li><a href="#dob">Date of birth – enter a real date</a></li>
  </ul>
</div>
```

Move focus to `#error-summary` immediately after a failed submit.
Each link in the list must take focus directly to the affected field.

---

## Critical: Do Not Block Paste

Never block paste, copy, or standard keyboard actions on any input.
**Blocking paste is Critical** — users with motor disabilities and those who use
password managers cannot re-type credentials they cannot physically type.

---

## Serious: Grouping Related Controls

Use `<fieldset>` + `<legend>` for related controls.
**Missing grouping is Serious** — radio and checkbox groups become unintelligible
without a group label.

```html
<fieldset>
  <legend>Notification preferences</legend>
  <label><input type="checkbox" name="email-notify"> Email</label>
  <label><input type="checkbox" name="sms-notify"> SMS</label>
</fieldset>
```

---

## Serious: Input Types

Use the most specific applicable input type. This surfaces the correct virtual
keyboard on mobile and provides semantic meaning to AT.

| Need | Use | Avoid |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Email address | `type="email"` | `type="text"` |
| Phone number | `type="tel"` | `type="number"` |
| Search | `type="search"` | `type="text"` |
| Web URL | `type="url"` | `type="text"` |
| Password | `type="password"` | `type="text"` |
| Date | See date guidance below | `type="text"` alone |

### `type="number"` — use with caution

`type="number"` has inconsistent screen reader support and unexpected behaviour
(scroll wheel changes values, non-numeric characters silently stripped).
**Prefer `type="text"` with `inputmode="numeric"` and `pattern="[0-9]*"`**
for quantities, codes, and amounts:

```html
<!-- Good: text input with numeric keyboard on mobile -->
<label for="quantity">Quantity</label>
<input type="text" id="quantity"
       inputmode="numeric"
       pattern="[0-9]*"
       autocomplete="off">

<!-- Only use type="number" when the stepper arrows are genuinely useful
     and the value range is small and well-defined -->
```

### Date inputs

Native `<input type="date">` has reasonable accessibility support in modern
browsers but inconsistent screen reader announcement. Evaluate against your
AT support matrix before using.

For complex date ranges or date pickers, prefer three separate labelled inputs
(day/month/year) over a custom calendar widget — they work with all AT without
JavaScript:

```html
<fieldset>
  <legend>Date of birth</legend>
  <label for="dob-day">Day</label>
  <input type="text" id="dob-day" inputmode="numeric"
         pattern="[0-9]{1,2}" autocomplete="bday-day"
         aria-describedby="dob-hint">
  <label for="dob-month">Month</label>
  <input type="text" id="dob-month" inputmode="numeric"
         pattern="[0-9]{1,2}" autocomplete="bday-month">
  <label for="dob-year">Year</label>
  <input type="text" id="dob-year" inputmode="numeric"
         pattern="[0-9]{4}" autocomplete="bday-year">
  <p id="dob-hint">For example: 23 4 1980</p>
</fieldset>
```

### `<select>` — single

Native `<select>` is well-supported by all AT. Use it for choosing one option
from a known, bounded list.

```html
<label for="country">Country</label>
<select id="country" autocomplete="country-name">
  <option value="">Select a country</option>
  <option value="ca">Canada</option>
  <option value="us">United States</option>
</select>
```

Always include a blank/placeholder option as the first `<option>` when no
default is appropriate — do not use `selected` to pre-select a value unless
it genuinely reflects the user's likely choice.

### `<select multiple>`

`<select multiple>` has **poor usability** for many users, including those
with motor and cognitive disabilities. The multi-select interaction (hold Shift
or Ctrl while clicking) is non-obvious and keyboard-unfriendly.

**Prefer checkboxes inside a `<fieldset>` for multiple selection** unless the
list is very long and a search/filter is provided:

```html
<!-- Prefer this over <select multiple> -->
<fieldset>
  <legend>Topics (select all that apply)</legend>
  <label><input type="checkbox" name="topic" value="html"> HTML</label>
  <label><input type="checkbox" name="topic" value="css"> CSS</label>
  <label><input type="checkbox" name="topic" value="js"> JavaScript</label>
</fieldset>
```

If `<select multiple>` must be used, add visible instructions:
`<p id="select-hint">Hold Ctrl (or Cmd on Mac) to select multiple options.</p>`
and reference it with `aria-describedby`.

### `<datalist>`

`<datalist>` provides autocomplete suggestions for a text input. It is
natively keyboard accessible and announced by most screen readers, but
announcement quality varies — test with your AT matrix.

```html
<label for="browser">Preferred browser</label>
<input type="text" id="browser"
       list="browsers"
       autocomplete="off"
       aria-describedby="browser-hint">
<datalist id="browsers">
  <option value="Chrome">
  <option value="Firefox">
  <option value="Safari">
  <option value="Edge">
</datalist>
<p id="browser-hint" class="visually-hidden">
  Start typing to see suggestions, or type your own value.
</p>
```

Note: `<datalist>` is not a replacement for a fully accessible combobox when
the suggestion list is the only valid set of values. Use `role="combobox"` with
the [APG Combobox pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/combobox/)
when the input must be constrained to the list.

## Serious: Autocomplete for Personal Data

Missing `autocomplete` on personal-data fields is **Serious** — it directly
impacts users with motor disabilities and cognitive conditions who rely on
autofill to avoid retyping.

```html
<input type="text"     id="name"         autocomplete="name">
<input type="email"    id="email"        autocomplete="email">
<input type="tel"      id="phone"        autocomplete="tel">
<input type="text"     id="street"       autocomplete="street-address">
<input type="text"     id="city"         autocomplete="address-level2">
<input type="text"     id="postal"       autocomplete="postal-code">
<input type="password" id="current-pass" autocomplete="current-password">
<input type="password" id="new-pass"     autocomplete="new-password">
```

Full list of valid `autocomplete` token values:
[WCAG 1.3.5 Input Purposes](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#input-purposes)

---

## Serious: Async & Status Feedback

* Use `aria-live="polite"` for non-critical updates (character counts, inline validation)
* Use `aria-live="assertive"` **only** for blocking failures — it interrupts
  the screen reader immediately
* Announce submission success and failure to AT

**Silent async failures are Serious** — screen reader users have no indication
the action completed or failed.

---

## Serious: 3.3.4 Error Prevention — Legal, Financial, Data

For forms that result in legal commitments, financial transactions, or permanent
data changes, users must be able to do at least one of:

* **Check** — review their input before final submission
* **Correct** — reverse, cancel, or modify the submission afterwards
* **Confirm** — an explicit confirmation step before the action is finalised

```html
<!-- Confirmation step pattern -->
<h2>Review your order</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>Item</dt><dd>Annual plan</dd>
  <dt>Amount</dt><dd>$120.00</dd>
</dl>
<button type="submit">Confirm and pay</button>
<a href="/cart">Edit order</a>
```

**Absent error prevention on financial/legal forms is Serious.** It may become
**Critical** in regulated contexts (financial services, legal agreements, medical
data) where the error cannot be undone.

---

## Moderate: Instructions

Provide concise instructions before complex input groups.
This is **Moderate** — most users can infer requirements, but users with cognitive
disabilities benefit from upfront guidance.

* Place instructions before the input, not after
* Provide format examples for unusual inputs: `Date: DD/MM/YYYY`
* Associate instructions with the field via `aria-describedby`

---

## Moderate: Session Timeout Warning

If the form session can expire, users **must** be warned before timeout occurs
(WCAG 2.2.1 Timing Adjustable). Give at least 20 seconds to extend the session,
and the warning itself must be accessible to AT.

```html
<!-- Timeout warning — inject when ~2 minutes remain -->
<div role="alertdialog" aria-modal="true"
     aria-labelledby="timeout-title" tabindex="-1" id="timeout-dialog">
  <h2 id="timeout-title">Your session will expire in 2 minutes</h2>
  <p>You will lose any unsaved form data.</p>
  <button type="button" id="extend-session">Stay signed in</button>
</div>
```

Move focus to the warning dialog. On "Stay signed in", reset the timer and
return focus to where the user was.

Session timeout is **Moderate** for informational forms; **Critical** for
transactional or legal submissions where data loss cannot be recovered.

---

## Moderate: Validation Timing

* Validate on submit at minimum
* Inline validation on blur (field exit) is acceptable when clearly scoped to
  the field just left — do not validate fields the user has not yet visited
* Avoid disruptive real-time validation while the user is actively typing

---
