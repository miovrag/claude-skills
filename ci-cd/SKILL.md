  Load this skill when configuring or reviewing CI/CD pipelines, GitHub Actions
  workflows, or automated testing setups. Ensures accessibility regressions are
  caught before code reaches production by enforcing quality gates, structured
  reporting, and a zero-debt strategy across all pages and user preferences.

# CI/CD Accessibility Skill

> **Canonical source**: `examples/CI_CD_ACCESSIBILITY_BEST_PRACTICES.md` in `mgifford/ACCESSIBILITY.md`
> This skill is derived from that file. When in doubt, the example is authoritative.

Apply these rules when adding, reviewing, or maintaining CI/CD accessibility checks.

---

## Core Mandate

Every CI/CD pipeline must prevent accessibility regressions from reaching production.
Automated checks are the baseline, not the ceiling — combine rule-based scanning with
accessibility tree testing and, where practical, virtual screen reader testing.

**Zero-Debt strategy:** target 100 % Lighthouse Accessibility and Performance scores
on all pages across all devices and user preferences.

---

## Severity Scale (this skill)

| Level | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical** | Blocks task completion entirely for one or more disability groups |
| **Serious** | Significantly impairs access; workaround unreasonable to expect |
| **Moderate** | Creates friction; workaround exists and is not too burdensome |
| **Minor** | Best-practice gap; marginal impact on access |

---

## Critical: Lighthouse CI Quality Gate

Enforce a strict score threshold. A drop to 99 % accessibility or performance **must
fail the build**.

**`.lighthouserc.js` (strict gate — use once baseline is clean):**
```javascript
module.exports = {
  ci: {
    collect: {
      staticDistDir: './_site',
      numberOfRuns: 1,
      settings: { emulatedFormFactor: 'mobile' },
    },
    assert: {
      assertions: {
        'categories:accessibility': ['error', { minScore: 1 }],
        'categories:performance':   ['error', { minScore: 1 }],
      },
    },
  },
};
```

**`.lighthouserc.json` (warn-first — use while resolving existing issues):**
```json
{
  "ci": {
    "collect": { "staticDistDir": "./_site", "numberOfRuns": 1 },
    "assert": {
      "assertions": {
        "categories:accessibility": ["warn", { "minScore": 0.9 }]
      }
    },
    "upload": { "target": "filesystem", "outputDir": ".lighthouseci" }
  }
}
```

> Start with `"warn"` + `minScore: 0.9`, then tighten to `"error"` + `minScore: 1`
> once the existing baseline is clean.

---

## Critical: axe-core on Every PR

Run axe-core via Playwright on every pull request to catch WCAG violations in
dynamic content (menus, modals, theme variants).

```typescript
// tests/a11y.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';
import AxeBuilder from '@axe-core/playwright';

const themes = ['light', 'dark'];

for (const theme of themes) {
  test(`A11y: Desktop & Mobile in ${theme} mode`, async ({ page }) => {
    await page.emulateMedia({ colorScheme: theme as 'light' | 'dark' });
    await page.goto('/');

    const menuBtn = page.locator('#main-menu-toggle');
    if (await menuBtn.isVisible()) await menuBtn.click();

    const results = await new AxeBuilder({ page })
      .withTags(['wcag2a', 'wcag2aa', 'wcag21aa', 'wcag22aa'])
      .analyze();

    expect(results.violations).toEqual([]);
  });
}
```

**Missing axe-core checks on PRs is Critical** — dynamic violations are invisible to
Lighthouse and reach production silently.

---

## Serious: GitHub Actions Workflows

### A. Lighthouse CI on every PR and push to `main`

```yaml
# .github/workflows/lighthouse.yml
name: Lighthouse CI

on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  lighthouse:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1
        with: { ruby-version: "3.2", bundler-cache: true }
      - run: bundle exec jekyll build
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with: { node-version: "22" }
      - run: npm install -g @lhci/cli
      - run: lhci autorun
```

### B. Scheduled accessibility scan with alert-fatigue guard

Run monthly; skip the scan when open `accessibility` issues already exist so
developers are not flooded with duplicate noise.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/accessibility-scan.yml
name: Accessibility Scan (Scheduled)

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 0 1 * *"   # first day of every month
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: write
  issues: write
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  accessibility-scanner:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Check for existing open accessibility issues
        id: check_issues
        env:
          GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GH_TOKEN || secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        run: |
          COUNT=$(gh issue list --label "accessibility" --state open --json number --jq '. | length')
          echo "count=$COUNT" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

      - name: Run GitHub Accessibility Scanner
        if: steps.check_issues.outputs.count == '0'
        uses: github/accessibility-scanner@v3
        with:
          urls: ${{ vars.ACCESSIBILITY_SCAN_URL || format('https://{0}.github.io/{1}/', github.repository_owner, github.event.repository.name) }}
          repository: ${{ github.repository }}
          token: ${{ secrets.GH_TOKEN || secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          cache_key: accessibility-scan-results
```

> Set the `ACCESSIBILITY_SCAN_URL` repository variable to override the default
> GitHub Pages URL. Multiple URLs can be provided as a newline-separated list.

### C. Full deep-crawl for AI-ready audit (manual trigger)

```yaml
name: Deep Site Audit
on: workflow_dispatch

jobs:
  crawl:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: npx playwright test --reporter=json > audit-report.json
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: a11y-json-report
          path: audit-report.json
```

---

## Serious: Accessibility Tree Testing

Automated WCAG rule checks verify markup compliance; they cannot verify what a
screen reader **actually announces**. Add accessibility tree tests for complex
components: SVG diagrams, custom widgets, live regions, navigation landmarks.

### Playwright aria snapshots (Playwright ≥ v1.46)

Assert the exact accessible name, role, and structure that assistive technologies
consume — distinct from axe-core rule checks.

```typescript
// tests/a11y-tree.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('main navigation is correctly announced', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/');
  await expect(page.locator('nav[aria-label="Main navigation"]'))
    .toMatchAriaSnapshot(`
      - navigation "Main navigation":
          - list:
              - listitem:
                  - link "Home"
              - listitem:
                  - link "About"
    `);
});

test('SVG diagram is exposed as a labelled image', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/diagrams');
  await expect(page.locator('svg[role="img"]').first())
    .toMatchAriaSnapshot(`
      - img "User Authentication Flowchart":
    `);
});
```

Generate baseline snapshots once with `--update-snapshots`; treat subsequent
diffs the same as visual regression diffs.

### Semantic role queries (any Playwright version)

```typescript
test('form controls have meaningful accessible names', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/contact');
  await expect(page.getByRole('textbox', { name: 'Email address' })).toBeVisible();
  await expect(page.getByRole('button',  { name: 'Send message'  })).toBeEnabled();
});
```

`getByRole()` fails immediately when accessible names are missing or wrong —
earlier feedback than a manual screen reader audit.

### Guidepup virtual screen reader (unit-level)

For asserting exact spoken output without a real screen reader installed:

```typescript
import { virtual } from '@guidepup/virtual-screen-reader';

it('announces the dialog title and action buttons', async () => {
  document.body.innerHTML = `
    <dialog open aria-labelledby="dlg-title">
      <h2 id="dlg-title">Confirm deletion</h2>
      <button>Delete</button>
      <button>Cancel</button>
    </dialog>
  `;
  await virtual.start({ container: document.body });
  const spoken = await virtual.spokenPhraseLog();
  expect(spoken).toContain('Confirm deletion');
  expect(spoken).toContain('Delete, button');
  await virtual.stop();
});
```

GitHub Actions setup for Guidepup:
```yaml
- uses: guidepup/setup-action@v2
- run: npx jest tests/sr.test.ts
```

---

## Moderate: Local-First Developer Workflow

Run audits locally before pushing — fastest feedback loop, keeps CI noise low.

**`package.json` scripts:**
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test:a11y":       "lhci autorun && npx playwright test",
    "test:a11y:local": "lhci collect --url=http://localhost:3000 && lhci assert"
  }
}
```

**Install once:**
```bash
npm install -g @lhci/cli
npm install -D @playwright/test @axe-core/playwright
```

---

## Moderate: Shift-Left Accessibility Strategy

Prevent issues from entering commits in the first place. Catch problems in order
from fastest to slowest feedback:

1. **In-editor / local lint** — framework-specific a11y lint rules run as you type.
2. **Pre-commit gate** — run checks on changed files only; block commit when checks
   fail. Use `pre-commit` (Python) or `husky` + `lint-staged` (Node). Keep total
   runtime ≤ 30–60 seconds.
3. **PR gate** — re-run in CI for trust and consistency; fail PR on blocking
   regressions; publish artifact links.
4. **Scheduled depth scans** — nightly/weekly deeper scans; auto-label findings;
   trend metrics over time in `ACCESSIBILITY.md`.

**Suggested Definition of Done addition:**
> No UI-impacting commit is accepted unless local/pre-commit accessibility checks
> pass and PR CI accessibility checks are green.

**Policy model:**
* **Fast fail locally** — contributors get immediate feedback before push.
* **Strict PR enforcement** — no merge with blocking accessibility failures.
* **Transparent metrics** — show pass rate, open defects, and remediation trend in `ACCESSIBILITY.md`.
* **Waiver discipline** — only time-bound waivers with explicit owner and expiry.

---

## Moderate: AI-Assisted Remediation Loop

Close the detect → fix gap using GitHub's accessibility scanner and the Copilot
coding agent:

1. The scheduled scan (workflow B above) uses `github/accessibility-scanner@v3`
   and creates issues labelled `accessibility`.
2. A companion remediation workflow watches for that label event and passes the
   issue to a Copilot coding agent.
3. The agent locates the offending code, applies a minimal fix, and opens a
   **draft pull request** linked to the original issue.
4. A human reviews and merges the draft PR.

Copy [`examples/AGENT_REMEDIATION_WORKFLOW.yml`](https://github.com/mgifford/ACCESSIBILITY.md/blob/main/examples/AGENT_REMEDIATION_WORKFLOW.yml)
to `.github/workflows/accessibility-remediation.yml` to enable this loop.

Covered violation types: `image-alt`, `label`, `link-name`, `heading-order`,
`color-contrast`, `aria-required-attr`.

> Requires a GitHub Copilot subscription with the coding agent feature enabled
> and **Settings → Copilot → "Allow Copilot to create and approve pull requests"**
> turned on.

## Tool Comparison

| Approach | Finds WCAG rule violations | Finds announcement quality issues | Works for SVG / canvas | CI-friendly |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| axe-core | ✅ | ❌ | Limited | ✅ |
| Lighthouse | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Playwright aria snapshots | Partial | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Guidepup virtual screen reader | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Manual screen reader testing | Partial | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |

No single tool catches everything — use the approaches together.

## Governance

* **Critical failures:** any page below 100 % Lighthouse Accessibility blocks the build.
* **Performance budget:** any page below 100 % Lighthouse Performance blocks the build.
* **Triage:** scheduled scan failures must be converted to GitHub Issues.
  If an issue remains open, subsequent scheduled scans are paused (alert-fatigue guard).
* **SLA:** triage critical failures within one business day; serious within one sprint.
