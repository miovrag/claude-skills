name: touch-pointer
description: >
  Load this skill whenever the project contains interactive UI elements that
  users touch, tap, click, drag, swipe, or gesture with — buttons, links,
  drag-and-drop interfaces, sliders, carousels, or custom touch interactions.
  Under no circumstances create touch targets smaller than 44×44 CSS pixels.
  Absolutely always provide pointer cancellation, single-pointer alternatives
  to gestures, and load alongside keyboard/SKILL.md since pointer and keyboard
  requirements are complementary.

# Touch and Pointer Accessibility Skill

> **Canonical source**: `examples/TOUCH_POINTER_ACCESSIBILITY_BEST_PRACTICES.md` in `mgifford/ACCESSIBILITY.md`
> This skill is derived from that file. When in doubt, the example is authoritative.

Apply these rules when implementing any interactive UI that users touch, click,
tap, drag, or gesture with.
**Load alongside `keyboard/SKILL.md` — pointer and keyboard requirements are complementary.**

---

## Core Mandate

WCAG 2.5.x criteria (introduced in WCAG 2.1 and extended in 2.2) address pointer,
touch, and motion-based interaction. These criteria exist because:

- Motor disabilities affect both keyboard use and pointer/touch precision
- Touch screens have different interaction affordances than mouse
- Many users alternate between keyboard and touch (tablets, convertibles)
- Voice control users activate elements by speaking visible labels — these must match

The full WCAG 2.5 set is listed in the criteria table. This skill covers the
most implementation-relevant patterns.

## Severity Scale (this skill)

| Level | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Critical** | Functionality only available via multi-point gesture with no single-pointer alternative; `user-scalable=no` prevents zoom |
| **Serious** | Drag-to-reorder with no keyboard/single-pointer alternative; touch target under 24×24px for primary actions |
| **Moderate** | Mousedown/touchdown action with no up-event cancellation; motion gesture without UI alternative |
| **Minor** | Target under 44×44px for non-primary actions; spacing between targets too small |

---

## Assistive Technology Context

| AT | How pointer/touch requirements apply |
|---|---|
| NVDA / JAWS | Primarily keyboard users — see `keyboard/SKILL.md`. Pointer events don't affect screen reader operation directly |
| VoiceOver (iOS) | Touch-based AT; uses tap, double-tap, swipe — standard HTML interactive elements work natively |
| TalkBack (Android) | Touch-based AT; double-tap to activate; swipe to navigate |
| Voice Control (iOS/macOS) | Activates elements by speaking visible labels; target size matters less than label accuracy |
| Dragon NaturallySpeaking | Click by number or by name; label accuracy critical |
| Switch access | Scans interactive elements; target size and order matter |
| Screen magnification | Small targets are harder to hit at high zoom; spacing prevents mis-taps |
| Stylus / eye gaze | Precision varies; larger targets with more spacing reduce error rate |

---

## Critical: Never Block Zoom (`user-scalable=no`)

Blocking browser zoom is **Critical** — it prevents low-vision users from
enlarging content to a usable size.

```html
<!-- Critical violation — never do this -->
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1,
      maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no">

<!-- Correct -->
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
```

Some libraries and frameworks add `user-scalable=no` automatically (Bootstrap
historically did this in mobile CSS). Audit your viewport meta tag on every
project.

---

## Critical: Single-Pointer Alternatives for Multi-Point Gestures (WCAG 2.5.1)

Any functionality that uses multi-point gestures (pinch-to-zoom, two-finger
rotate, three-finger swipe) **must** also be available via a single-pointer
interaction.

```html
<!-- Map with pinch zoom — provide button alternatives -->
<div role="group" aria-label="Map controls">
  <button type="button" aria-label="Zoom in">+</button>
  <button type="button" aria-label="Zoom out">−</button>
</div>
```

Path-based gestures (swipe, draw) must also have a single-tap or button
alternative. Examples:
- **Swipe-to-delete:** also provide a delete button
- **Swipe-to-reveal:** also provide a menu or button
- **Draw to sign:** also accept typed name as an alternative where legally permitted

---

## Critical: Drag with No Alternative (WCAG 2.5.7 — WCAG 2.2)

Drag-and-drop interfaces must provide a single-pointer (click/tap) or keyboard
alternative. **Drag with no alternative is Serious to Critical.**

```html
<!-- Reorderable list — provide up/down buttons as drag alternative -->
<ul id="priority-list">
  <li>
    <span class="drag-handle" aria-hidden="true">⠿</span>
    Task A
    <button type="button" aria-label="Move Task A up">↑</button>
    <button type="button" aria-label="Move Task A down">↓</button>
  </li>
</ul>
```

The alternative does not need to look like the drag — it just needs to
provide the same result (reordering, moving between columns, etc.).

---

## Serious: Target Size Minimum (WCAG 2.5.8 — WCAG 2.2)

Interactive targets must be at least **24×24 CSS pixels** (AA requirement).
**Below 24×24 is Serious.** The recommended size for primary actions is **44×44px**.

```css
/* Minimum — WCAG 2.5.8 AA */
button, a, [role="button"], input[type="checkbox"], input[type="radio"] {
  min-width:  24px;
  min-height: 24px;
}

/* Recommended for primary controls */
.primary-action {
  min-width:  44px;
  min-height: 44px;
}
```

When a target is smaller than 44×44px, ensure its **offset** (the spacing
around it) makes up the difference — a 20×20px icon button with 12px padding
on all sides meets the 44×44 guideline.

```css
/* Small icon button — padding provides target space */
.icon-btn {
  width: 20px;
  height: 20px;
  padding: 12px; /* Total clickable area: 44×44px */
}
```

For inline text links, target size exceptions apply — the WCAG exception
covers inline links in a sentence (where requiring 44px height would break
text flow).

---

## Serious: Pointer Cancellation (WCAG 2.5.2)

Actions triggered on `mousedown` or `touchstart` (the "down" event) cannot
be cancelled. Actions must complete on the "up" event (`mouseup`, `touchend`,
`click`) so users can abort by moving the pointer away.

```js
// Wrong — fires on mousedown, cannot be cancelled
button.addEventListener('mousedown', () => deleteItem());

// Right — fires on click (mouseup equivalent); user can drag away to cancel
button.addEventListener('click', () => deleteItem());
```

For drag operations, completion on `drop` (the up-event equivalent) is correct.
Custom gesture libraries should use up-events for final action.

---

## Serious: Motion Actuation Alternative (WCAG 2.5.4)

Functionality activated by device motion (shake, tilt) must have a UI alternative.
Users must also be able to disable the motion trigger to prevent accidental activation.

```js
// Device motion — always provide UI alternative
if (window.DeviceMotionEvent) {
  window.addEventListener('devicemotion', handleShake);
}

// UI alternative — always present regardless of motion support
document.getElementById('undo-btn').addEventListener('click', undoLastAction);

// Allow user to disable motion trigger
document.getElementById('disable-motion').addEventListener('change', (e) => {
  if (e.target.checked) {
    window.removeEventListener('devicemotion', handleShake);
  }
});
```

---

## Moderate: Adaptive Target Sizing with CSS Media Queries

Use `pointer` media query to provide larger targets on coarse-pointer (touch)
devices and tighter targets on fine-pointer (mouse) devices:

```css
/* Base: fine pointer (mouse) */
.nav-item a {
  padding: 4px 8px;
}

/* Touch/coarse pointer: expand hit area */
@media (pointer: coarse) {
  .nav-item a {
    padding: 12px 16px;
    min-height: 44px;
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
  }
}
```

`@media (pointer: coarse)` targets touch screens and styluses.
`@media (pointer: fine)` targets mouse and trackpad.
`@media (any-pointer: coarse)` also matches when a coarse pointer is *available*
(e.g., a laptop with a touchscreen) — use when you want to offer touch-friendly
sizing even on hybrid devices.

---

## Moderate: Touch Target Spacing

Adjacent small targets need spacing to prevent mis-taps — particularly
important for users with tremor, motor difficulties, or at high magnification.

```css
/* Spacing between adjacent icon buttons */
.toolbar button + button {
  margin-left: 8px;
}

/* Checkbox/radio spacing */
.option-group label {
  display: block;
  padding: 8px 0; /* vertical spacing between options */
}
```

WCAG 2.5.8 allows targets smaller than 24×24px if the offset (spacing to
adjacent targets) ensures the total space per target is at least 24×24px.

---

## Moderate: Touch-Specific Interaction Patterns

**Swipe carousels:** must have prev/next button alternatives; auto-advancing
must pause on focus/hover/touch; `prefers-reduced-motion` must disable animation.

**Pull-to-refresh:** must have a button alternative; must not be the only
way to refresh content.

**Long-press context menus:** must have a right-click or button alternative
for desktop users; must not be the only way to access important actions.

**Custom touch gestures (swipe, pinch in a non-map context):** document them
clearly; always provide single-pointer alternatives.

---

## Moderate: Label in Name for Voice Control (WCAG 2.5.3)

Voice Control users (Dragon NaturallySpeaking, iOS Voice Control) activate
elements by speaking their visible label. **The accessible name must contain
the visible text.**

```html
<!-- Serious violation: aria-label overrides visible text -->
<button aria-label="Submit application">Send</button>
<!-- User says "click Send" — does not work because accessible name is "Submit application" -->

<!-- Correct: accessible name contains visible text -->
<button aria-label="Send application form">Send</button>
<!-- Or simply: -->
<button>Send</button>
<!-- If context makes "Send" clear, no aria-label needed -->
```

The accessible name must **begin with** or **contain** the visible text string.
Adding context before or after is fine: "Send application" ✓, "Submit" when
visible text is "Send" ✗.

---

## Minor: `touch-action` CSS Property

Explicitly declare `touch-action` on elements that handle their own touch
events to prevent browser interference:

```css
/* Allow vertical scroll but prevent horizontal swipe (carousel) */
.carousel { touch-action: pan-y; }

/* Custom drag element — prevent default browser panning */
.draggable { touch-action: none; }

/* Do not suppress all touch actions on interactive elements */
button { touch-action: auto; /* default */ }
```

Overusing `touch-action: none` can block scrolling on touch devices — only
use it on elements that genuinely handle their own touch events.
